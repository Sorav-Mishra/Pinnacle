Mendel’s Law of Dominance, also known as the first law of inheritance states that when parents with pure, contrasting traits are crossed, the trait appearing in the next generation is the dominant one, and the hybrid offspring will display only the dominant trait in their phenotype. Law of Independent Assortment : It states that when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, the segregation of one pair of characters occurs independently of the other pair. This law is based on observations from dihybrid crosses."
