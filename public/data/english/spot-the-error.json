However, in this sentence, there is no comparison being made between multiple homes or qualities. So, we can use the adjective \"clean\" alone.

      "correct_answer": "C. by ink",
      "explanation": "by ink There is a prepositional error in the given sentence. The preposition ‘by’ must be replaced with ‘in’ because we generally write ‘in ink’ for example ﬁll the form in blue ink, sign the cheque in ink, etc. Similarly, in the given sentence, the documents need to be signed in ink.

However, we write daughter-in-law for a single female and daughters-in-law for more than two females. Similarly, the given sentence talks about two daughters-in-law.
