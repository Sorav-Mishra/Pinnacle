      "explanation": "CsOH>KOH>NaOH>LiOH. This order is due to the increasing size of the alkali metal ions, which leads to better solvation and greater basicity. As you move down the group, the basicity increases because the larger alkali metal ions (like Cs⁺) can more easily dissociate and interact with water compared to the smaller ions (like Li⁺)."

      "correct_answer": "B. ",
      "explanation": "Fusion : The process by which a substance transitions from a solid to a liquid state. Solidification refers to the change from a liquid or gas to a solid state. Condensation is the transition from gas to liquid, the reverse of vaporization, which is the conversion from liquid or solid to gas. Sublimation is the direct change from solid to gas without passing through the liquid phase."
